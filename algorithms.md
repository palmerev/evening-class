An algorithm is a process for solving some problem that takes some input and gives some output. Studying algorithms helps us hone our ability to understand different kinds of problems and describe solutions in ways that can be executed reliably. You have your own algorithms for brushing your teeth or making a sandwich, but describing the steps involved to a computer may be more difficult than it first appears.

There are two key aspects of algorithms to consider:
  - Correctness: _Does is solve the problem?_
  - Efficiency: _How fast is it?_
