## A few notes on functions, methods, parameters, and arguments

When creating an object or constructor, consider two things:
- What information does the object need when it's created?
  - For an object literal, put it directly into the object
  - For a constructor, put include parameters in the definition
- What information does each method need?
  - Consider if a method needs information that's not already inside the object. If it does, add a parameter to the method.
  - It sometimes helps to think about how you would **call** a method.
  _Think about how you want to interact with the object_ when you call a method and work backwards to the definition.
